# Data Analysis of Netflix's Content Library 🍿
Data processing &amp; Data visualization project undertaken during DS &amp; ML Internship at Techmaghi (May-June 2025).

The objective of this project is to access, analyze & assess the data of Netflix’s global catalogue of Movies & TV shows across multiple languages to uncover patterns and trends that could be used to inform Netflix’s strategy moving forward. 🎥 🎬

The personal objective of this project was to deepen my understanding of fundamental techniques in data extraction, manipulation, and presentation as I begin my first foray into the world of Data science. This project is for me to practice using sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib & seaborn libraries in Python. 🐍

# Tools &amp; Resources Used
The database used here was sourced from Kaggle. 🇰
- [Database - Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

SQL though Sqlite3 was used for viewing, changing & comparing data within the given CSV file. 📁

The python libraries pandas, matplotlib & seaborn were used in conjunction for the loading, then the visualization of the data in the form of vertical & horizontal barcharts, Histogram + Kernel density line and line charts. 📈

The final report was written by me alone using Canva Docs. 📄
